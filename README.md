# TypeScript

Welcome to the TypeScript Superpowers Course! This course is designed to help you learn TypeScript from the basics to more advanced concepts. By the end of this course, you'll be able to confidently use TypeScript in real-world projects.

## Course Overview

This course is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of TypeScript:

1. **Introduction**
2. **Variables and Values (Primitive)**
3. **Variables and Values (Non-Primitive)**
4. **Interfaces and Type Aliases**
5. **Generics Type**
6. **Projects (Cashier Application)**

## Course Slides

I'm using Marp for the slides. You can find the slides for each section in the `slides` directory. The slides are written in Markdown format and can be viewed using the [Marp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) extension in Visual Studio Code. Make sure to install the Marp extension to view the slides. Otherwise, you can view the slides directly in the Markdown format.
